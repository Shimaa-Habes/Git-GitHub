--set-upstream
git push impact : After running git push -u origin main once,
                  subsequent pushes from my local main branch can 
                  be just: git push.
git pull impact : After setting the upstream with -u, 
                  Git knows which remote (origin) and branch (main) to use.
                  While on the main branch, we can simply run git pull.
                  Git will automatically pull from the correct remote and branch.
